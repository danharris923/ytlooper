# üéµ Punch Looper

A Chrome extension that adds A/B looping functionality to HTML5 video and audio elements, like a guitar looper pedal.

![Punch Looper Icon](public/icons/icon-128.png)

## Features

- **Simple Controls**: Use `[` and `]` keys to set loop points, `\` to stop

- **Smart Detection**: Automatically finds the active media element
- **Low CPU Usage**: Efficient `requestAnimationFrame` loop engine
- **Built-in Metronome**: Helps with timing and rhythm practice
- **Fine Control**: Precise 0.1 semitone pitch adjustments
- **Boss RC-Style GUI**: Authentic guitar pedal interface with mouse control
- **Interactive Knobs**: Drag to adjust pitch, speed, and volume
- **LED Status Indicators**: Visual feedback for A/B points and loop state
- **Draggable Interface**: Position the pedal GUI anywhere on screen
- **Configurable**: Adjust timing and audio settings

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run build` to build the extension
4. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
5. Enable "Developer mode"
6. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist/` folder

## Usage

### Keyboard Shortcuts

#### Basic Looping
- **`[`** - Set point A (punch in)
- **`]`** - Set point B (punch out) and start looping  
- **`\`** - Stop loop

#### Audio Control (NEW! üéõÔ∏è)
- **`Shift + =`** - Increase playback speed
- **`Shift + -`** - Decrease playback speed
- **`Shift + ‚Üë`** - Pitch up (0.5 semitones)
- **`Shift + ‚Üì`** - Pitch down (0.5 semitones)
- **`Shift + ‚Üê`** - Fine pitch down (0.1 semitones)
- **`Shift + ‚Üí`** - Fine pitch up (0.1 semitones)
- **`Shift + R`** - Reset pitch and speed to normal
- **`Shift + E`** - Toggle high-quality audio engine

#### Loop Edge Adjustment
- **`Shift + <`** - Move point A backward
- **`Shift + >`** - Move point A forward
- **`Shift + :`** - Move point B backward
- **`Shift + "`** - Move point B forward

#### Metronome
- **`Shift + M`** - Toggle metronome

#### Guitar Pedal GUI (NEW! üé∏)
- **`Shift + G`** - Toggle YT Looper pedal interface
- **Extension Icon Click** - Opens the pedal GUI automatically

### How It Works

**Keyboard Control (Traditional)**
1. Navigate to any page with video/audio (like YouTube)
2. Press `[` to mark the start of your loop (point A)
3. Press `]` to mark the end and immediately start looping (point B)
4. Use `Shift + ‚Üë/‚Üì` to adjust pitch, `Shift + +/-` to adjust speed
5. Press `Shift + E` to enable the high-quality audio engine for better pitch control
6. Press `\` to stop the loop

**Guitar Pedal GUI (Mouse Control)**
1. Click the extension icon in the toolbar OR press `Shift + G` to show the pedal interface
2. Click the large square footswitch to set A, then B, then start looping
3. Drag the **PITCH** knob to adjust pitch (maintains speed)
4. Drag the **TEMPO** knob to adjust speed (maintains pitch)  
5. Drag the **LEVEL** knob to control volume
6. Click the blue **HQ** LED to toggle the high-quality audio engine
7. Click the **SET** gear to open advanced settings (latency, edge bleed, etc.)
8. Drag the pedal to reposition it anywhere on screen

The extension automatically detects the active media element and works seamlessly with single-page applications.

### Audio Engine Modes

**Basic Mode (Default)**
- Uses native HTML5 playback rate control
- Pitch and speed are linked (changing speed affects pitch)
- Lower CPU usage, compatible everywhere

**High-Quality Mode (Shift + E)**
- Uses Web Audio API with AudioWorklet processing
- Independent pitch and speed control
- Professional-grade audio processing
- Slightly higher CPU usage, requires modern browser

### Why Better Than YouTube's Built-in Speed Control?

YouTube's native speed control has a major limitation: changing speed also changes pitch, creating that "chipmunk" or "slow-motion" effect that sounds terrible for music practice. 

**Punch Looper solves this by:**
- **Independent Control**: Change speed without affecting pitch, or pitch without affecting speed
- **High-Quality Processing**: Uses advanced Web Audio API algorithms instead of simple playback rate changes
- **Musical Intervals**: Pitch control in musically meaningful semitone increments
- **Fine Control**: 0.1 semitone precision for perfect tuning
- **Professional Interface**: Authentic Boss RC loop station GUI with tactile knob controls
- **Mouse + Keyboard**: Use whichever control method feels more natural
- **Professional Features**: Built-in metronome, loop edge adjustment, and more

### GUI Design

The pedal interface is inspired by professional looper pedals with:
- **Authentic red and black color scheme** 
- **Chrome knobs** with realistic shadows and gradients
- **Status LEDs** (green for A/B points, red for loop, blue for HQ engine)
- **Large square footswitch** for professional feel
- **Settings gear** for quick access to latency and timing controls
- **Stereo input jacks** visual detail
- **YTLOOPER branding** and professional typography
- **Draggable positioning** - place it wherever works best
- **Taller enclosure** for better proportions and more authentic look

## Settings

**Quick Access:** Click the settings gear (‚öôÔ∏è) on the pedal interface  
**Advanced:** Go to `chrome://extensions/` and click "Options" on the extension

### Quick Settings (Pedal Interface)
- **Latency Compensation** - Adjust timing to compensate for audio delay
- **Loop Edge Bleed** - Control overlap before/after loop points for smoother transitions  
- **Double Tap Window** - Set time window for double-tap to reset loops

### Full Options Page
Access the complete settings interface for additional configuration options.

### Audio Engine Settings

- **Latency Compensation**: Pre-roll time to compensate for playback latency (0-100ms)
- **Loop Edge Epsilon**: Precision threshold for loop edge detection (1-50ms)  
- **Edge Bleed**: Overlap before A and after B for smoother loops (0-300ms)

## Technical Details

- **Manifest V3** Chrome extension
- **TypeScript** with ES2020 target
- **Vite** build system
- **requestAnimationFrame** for efficient looping
